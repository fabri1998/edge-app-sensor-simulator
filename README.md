# edge-app-sensor-simulator
Edge-App for simulation of industrial sensors.

An edge app in IoT-Open where customers can easily add virtual sensors to simulate real data. This allows them to test different sensors, see what type of data is generated, and experiment with analytics tools like Grafana without the need to physically install hardware or write their own scripts.
